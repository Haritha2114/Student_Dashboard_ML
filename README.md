# Student_Dashboard_ML

A data-driven student analytics dashboard built using **Next.js** and **Python** for analysis and machine learning. This project uses a synthetic student dataset to analyze cognitive skills, predict assessment scores, and cluster students into learning personas.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

### Dataset
The synthetic dataset includes the following fields:

- `student_id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Student name
- `class`: Class/section
- `comprehension`, `attention`, `focus`, `retention`: Cognitive skill scores
- `assessment_score`: Overall performance score
- `engagement_time`: Time spent on learning activities

---

### Tasks & Features

1. **Data Analysis & ML**
   - Analyze correlations between cognitive skills and performance.
   - Build a simple ML model (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict `assessment_score`.
   - Cluster students into learning personas (e.g., high performers, balanced learners).

2. **Next.js Dashboard**
   - **Overview stats**: Average scores, skill summaries.
   - **Charts**:
     - Bar chart: Skill vs assessment score.
     - Scatter chart: Attention vs performance.
     - Radar chart: Individual student profile.
   - **Student Table**: Searchable and sortable table of students.
   - **Insights Section**: Key findings from analysis.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis, correlations, ML model, and clustering.
- **Next.js Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations and student table.

## ðŸ’» Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haritha2114/Student_Dashboard_ML.git
cd Student_Dashboard_ML

## 2. Python environment (analysis + ML)

```bash
# Optionally create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Next.js dashboard
```bash
cd web
npm install

### 4. Run the dashboard
```bash
# Default port 3000
npm run dev

# Or specify a custom port if 3000 is in use
npx next dev -p 3001


Open your browser at http://localhost:3000
 (or your chosen port) to view the dashboard.
